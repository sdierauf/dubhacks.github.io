            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Who can attend?</strong>
              <p>All students from any university can attend. Apply with your<strong> .edu</strong> email address and you are ready to go. If you do not fit in this category, feel free to contact us.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>When is DubHacks?</strong>
              <p>The hackathon will be held in Fall 2014. The gates will open on Friday, October 17th at 5:00pm and continue onto the following day until 8:00 p.m. when the prizes will be given out. For those who wish to arrive earlier in the week, there will be workshops as a build up to the final hackathon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>What should I bring?</strong>
              <p>All your hack gear. Passion, keyboard, mouse, laptop and other necessary hardware (don't forget your chargers!). Along with that you are free to bring toiletries, sleeping bags and a change of clothes. You should bring any valid form of identification and your ticket for security purposes.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>How much does this event cost?</strong>
              <p>Absolutely free. Make sure to bring your friends!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>How big are teams?</strong>
              <p>A team can be as big as 5 people or could consist of a couple of people. It is not necessary that you form your teams before the hackathon. In fact it would be better if you network around and make your final team at that time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>How do I get there?</strong>
              <p>This really depends on where you live. If you live in or close to one of these locations, then let us know in the application and we will let you know if we can help you our with the travel. The hackathon will be held here:<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Husky+Union+Building+HUB"> The Husky Union Building (HUB)</a></p>

            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>What should I build?</strong>
              <p>Anything really. The project is up to you and your team. You have 24 hours to make something, anything from the web, desktop apps, mobile apps or even traditional software.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Are we allowed to build on past projects?</strong>
              <p>A hackathon is an experience to build on something completely new within a set amount of time. With that in mind, you cannot work on past projects. Using your own API's or Third Party API's is alright as long as the project is a fresh start.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><strong>I have a different question. Who can I ask?</strong>
              <p>You can send an email across to contact@dubhacks.co, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>
